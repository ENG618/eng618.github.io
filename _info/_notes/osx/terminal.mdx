# Setting up your Terminal with zsh and iTerm2

I'll be combining a couple different tutorials that I will like to in the footnotes.  As well as some minor differences that I have updated for my personal use.

## Installing Xcode

Ensure Xcode developer tools are installed with:

```zsh
xcode-select â€”-install
```

## Install Homebrew

If homebrew is not installed do so now with:

```zsh
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

[source](https://brew.sh)

## Install iTerm2 via Homebrew

```zsh
brew cask install iterm2
```

## Install zsh

Make sure you have the latest zsh installed

```zsh
brew install zsh
```

## Install Oh My Zsh

```zsh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

Once installed install your various plugins, by adding them to the plugins array in your `~/.zshrc`.

Here are the [list of plugins](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins) or check out the [wiki](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Plugins)

Keep you upgrade oh my zsh with:

```zsh
upgrade_oh_my_zsh
```

## Change the default theme

## Install fonts for Powerlines

[Powerline fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) allows to use some really helpful additions to the command prompt that make it easier to read.

It can be installed with the following:

```zsh
# clone
git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git --depth=1
# install
cd fonts
./install.sh
# clean-up a bit
cd ..
rm -rf fonts
```

## Add Aliases
